## üìå Project Overview

**Color-Based Ball Tracking With OpenCV** is a computer vision project that uses color segmentation to track the movement of balls in a video. It detects the color of each ball, determines its position in frame quadrants, logs entry and exit times, and generates an annotated output video showing tracking details.

---

## üé• Demo & Files

- **Input Video**: `AI Assignment video.mp4`
- **Output Video**: `processed_video.avi`
- **Event Log**: `events.csv`

The output video contains overlays indicating the ball's position, direction, and quadrant transitions. All events are timestamped and saved for review in the CSV file.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Color-Based-Ball-Tracking-With-OpenCV.git
cd Color-Based-Ball-Tracking-With-OpenCV
````

### 2. Install dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3.7+ and Jupyter installed. Then run:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy imutils
```

Or install from within the notebook.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook "trani model.ipynb"
```

2. Run the cells in sequence:

   * Load and preprocess the video
   * Apply HSV-based color masking
   * Detect ball contours and calculate positions
   * Log entry/exit events based on quadrant transitions
   * Write results to `processed_video.avi` and `events.csv`

3. Review the output files in the root directory.

## üìä Sample Event Log (`events.csv`)

| Timestamp   | Color | Event   | Quadrant |
| ----------- | ----- | ------- | -------- |
| 00:00:05.12 | Red   | Entered | Q1       |
| 00:00:06.45 | Red   | Exited  | Q2       |
| 00:00:07.21 | Green | Entered | Q3       |
